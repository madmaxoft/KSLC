Doing:
======





To do:
======
	+ Allow creation of new rooms
	+ udlgDuplicateRooms: preview the duplication and highlight conflicts 
	+ List shifts / warps / powerups in selected rooms
	+ TfrmMain: Global KnyttScript (tab?)
	+ Undo
	+ TKSRoomView is way too slow
	+ TfrmMain: tileset background chooser (imgTileBg)
	+ TKSRoomView: CheckRoomContents()
	+ TfrmRoomList generic form for displaying a list of rooms that need attention / search result etc.
	+ When duplicating, list rooms with absolute shifts that need to be taken care of
	+ TReachCalc: calculate area that can be reached (single room or whole level)
		- take powerups into consideration
		- for unneeded rooms, only store wall reachability
			- nay, won't be enough, must also store motion vectors (?)
			- or swap to disk (?)
.		- basic get/set functions
.		- main loop
.		- Juni Rect-checking (MIN_WIDTH * MIN_HEIGHT rect passable in [x, y])
		- calculation
			- from point
.				- check for immediate wallswim
				- fall down, left, right
			- from edge
.		- swap in / out on low memory
	+ TKSMapView: view another set of rooms if required (to be used for duplication / paste preview)
	+ Clipboard: conversion [set of TKSRoom] <-> plaintext
		-> Rooms copiable between files and multiple instances of KSLC
	+ TfrmMain: make a screenshot of current room
	+ Switchable views:
		- std KSLE
		- KSLC classic
		- KSLC editor (all windows within one parent window)
			- one full view, one single-layer editor, one shrunk layer chooser (what layout?)
		- KSLC editor full (layers not in a scroller, but each in its own editor-box; L3 with special "mask" twin
			- wont fit even on the largest screen, needs ~ 1300 x 2000
		- custom (?)
	+ Use pngimage's zlib instead of zlib1.dll
		-- ZLibEx tried and didnt work ("data error")
	+ Multi-room param change: change existing warp / shift values
	+ TPassFilter: filter out points that cannot be reached due to simple passability restrictions
	+ TCritterChecker:
		- check whether critters can walk in thin air
		- check jumpers whether they have enough space above
		- needs to know object type movement types and params
			- jump (height)
			- walk until L3 block (dimensions?)
	? can anyone jump 24 + 8 px on basejump?
		- doesnt seem so
	+ Undo
	+ Editting
	+ TfrmMain: ask the user to save changes before closing
	+ Settings: remember window coords and visibility
		+ Powerups list
		+ Wallswim list
